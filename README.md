# Translator-Tech
LOCAL TRANSLATOR   Problematic and opportunity  It has been a huge problem particularly in Cameroon which is that of identifying the cultures and tradition of our country which are actually down grading as years go on, with an increase in technologies that render these newbies of the 21 centuries to be out of track due to the increase in the social media powers from American and European countries which keep pumping our phones and diverts these new generation from their cultures and tradition. Me myself I am one of those victims and many other relations I know having this same issue. This problematic of not being able to have more knowledge of our cultures and traditions. Some of us are orphans whether from parents or from grand parents having pass by this opportunity to know more about what is all about. Having the possibility not only to learn our languages, but also to have this educational content possible to listen in the form of language we desire, from Frhohjkhench to traditional language and more. Culture is an aspect that we usually don’t neglect but when we observe European countries, that is actually what makes their power, that is what distinguishes us even we are in European countries, it’s the only factor that assembles us together.
