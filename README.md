# **Translator-Tech**
<br>
LOCAL TRANSLATOR   Problematic and opportunity  It has been a huge problem particularly in Cameroon which is that of identifying the cultures and tradition of our country which are actually down grading as years go on, with an increase in technologies that render these newbies of the 21 centuries to be out of track due to the increase in the social media powers from American and European countries which keep pumping our phones and diverts these new generation from their cultures and tradition. Me myself I am one of those victims and many other relations I know having this same issue. This problematic of not being able to have more knowledge of our cultures and traditions. Some of us are orphans whether from parents or from grand parents having pass by this opportunity to know more about what is all about. Having the possibility not only to learn our languages, but also to have this educational content possible to listen in the form of language we desire, from Frhohjkhench to traditional language and more. Culture is an aspect that we usually don’t neglect but when we observe European countries, that is actually what makes their power, that is what distinguishes us even we are in European countries, it’s the only factor that assembles us together.

In this project, the following files are explained.

1. **AudioConverter.ipynb** 
    This files serves in converting the audio file content in the Yemba and Nguemba folders into either .mp3 or .wav files
    
2. **The GoogleAPI_Transcription.ipynb**  
     This file is used to test for the input section from where the client will have to do voices to the app in order
     to check how good the google api tends to transcript the voices obtained from teh clients. 
     Time complexity is also to be tested on this file to check for latency from the clients input to convertion.

3. **voice_Data_Preprocessing.ipynb**
     This mostly contains the preprocessing step to be done over the audio files from Yemba and Ngeumba folder

4. **Audio_Preanalysis.ipyng**
     Thuis file contains the steps contains to do some descriptive analysis on the audio files and understand how
     the librosa library works and an introduction to future extarction

5. **Note:** The two folders under the name of Yemba and Ngeumba contains the audio files of the traditional local languages 
      of Cameroon.
